# Language Suggester

#### Created by Alma Frankenstein, August 2020
#### Epicodus Project Week 2

## Description

This was a class assignment to demonstrate forms and branching. It asks the user to answer a series of questions, then suggests a programming language best suited to them.

## Setup

Clone this repo using:

```git clone https://github.com/alma-frankenstein/languageSuggester langSuggester```

Open index.html in your browser to view the page

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Known Bugs
* If the survey is filled out repeatedly without reloading the page between, the new answer will be added to
the previous one, instead of replacing it.

* It would be helpful to alert the user when a question hasn't been answered before submitting. Currently,
if none of the questions are answered the default suggestion is 'Python'.
